## Selection safety rules

- A `DEFERRED_BY_OWNER` action remains open but is skipped for current assistant execution.
- Skipping a deferred action never marks its gate accepted or lowers its priority permanently.
- If an earlier unresolved action is owner-required/deferred, only later `parallel_safe=true` actions may be selected.
- Provider, payment, destructive, legal and protected Production boundaries still require their existing approvals.
- Phase 8 remains outside the current finishline.
